Story
As a coding instructor at a mobile edutech firm, I've had the privilege of traveling to different schools to teach learners. While this experience has been rewarding, it's also introduced me to the challenges of tracking transportation expenses. Our company management struggled to accurately account for these costs, leading to frustrating and time-consuming manual tracking and reporting.

One month, I was tasked with calculating our total transportation expenses. I quickly realized just how difficult and tedious this process was. The task involved gathering receipts, logging miles, and making assumptions about unaccounted expenses. Even with Excel, the process was cumbersome and prone to errors.

This experience sparked an idea - what if there was a better way to track and manage transportation expenses? I envisioned a solution that would simplify this process, eliminate inaccuracies, and provide clear insights into our spending.

And so, TrakIT was born. I created this web-based expense tracking application to address the specific pain points I experienced. With TrakIT, company management can easily create user accounts, transfer funds, track expenses, and generate accurate financial reports. No more tedious manual tracking or assumptions - just streamlined financial management.

I'm proud to have turned a frustrating experience into a solution that can benefit others facing similar challenges.


Next Iteration

I plan to add more features, such as automated expense tracking and integration with accounting software.
